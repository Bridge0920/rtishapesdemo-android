RTI Shapes Demo For Android
======================

RTI Shapes Demo For Android is an application based on RTI Connext DDS that illustrates the powerful integration capabilities of the RTI Connext DDS software. These include data-centric publish/subscribe, real-time Quality of Service (QoS), fault tolerance and automatic discovery.

You will find instructions on how to install and run RTI Shapes Demo for Android in this [README](https://github.com/rticommunity/rti-shapesdemo-android/blob/master/ShapesDemo/README.md) file.

You can also download the desktop version of RTI Shapes Demo from the [RTI website](http://www.rti.com/downloads/shapes-demo.html). 

Note that this version of RTI Shapes Demo For Android uses the RTI Connext DDS Java API.  There is also a version that uses the C API of RTI Connext DDS Micro via JNI, if you get the branch from github tagged "SHAPES_DEMO_FOR_MICRO" from https://github.com/rticommunity/rtishapesdemo-android.
