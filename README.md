RTI Shapes Demo For Android
======================

RTI Shapes Demo For Android is an application based on RTI Connext DDS Micro that illustrates the powerful integration capabilities of the RTI Connext DDS software. These include data-centric publish/subscribe, real-time Quality of Service (QoS), fault tolerance and automatic discovery.

You will find instructions on how to install and run RTI Shapes Demo for Android in this [README](https://github.com/rticommunity/rti-shapesdemo-android/blob/master/ShapesDemo/README.md) file.

You can also download the desktop version of RTI Shapes Demo from the [RTI website](http://www.rti.com/downloads/shapes-demo.html). Note that the desktop version of RTI Shapes Demo runs RTI Connext DDS rather than RTI Connext DDS Micro.
